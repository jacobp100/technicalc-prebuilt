# TechniCalc Prebuilt

Bulids [technicalc-calculator](https://github.com/jacobp100/technicalc-calculator), [technicalc-editor](https://github.com/jacobp100/technicalc-editor) for the TechniCalc app and for sharing equations on the TechniCalc page on [jacob does code](https://jacobdoes.code.com/technicalc).

Also builds MathJax for use in React Native, using more hacks than you could shake a stick at.

Not published as a package, because for my workflow, it's easier to just copy and paste files.
